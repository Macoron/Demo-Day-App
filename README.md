![](img/screenshot.png)

## About
In AR/VR lab we used to have demo days, where all developers present what they have done last sprint. Each team prepared small presentation and showed it to other teams. 

This app helps to organize such demo days, calculate expected duration and randomize presentations order. Hope you'll find it handy.
